Hello. I was able to find Blind SQL injection on the https://███/
Database appears to be MySQL 5.

By issuing sleep(0) response will be delayed to 0 seconds.
By issuing sleep(1) response will be delayed to 5 seconds.
By issuing sleep(2) response will be delayed to 10 seconds.
By issuing sleep(5) response will be delayed to 25 seconds.

As POC, I retrieved count of databases (3). No other information was accessed (such as tables or data):

Apparently, SQL statement is executing 5 times on the database side, because response time always 5 times bigger than supplied sleep value.

Impact
SQL injection usually have high-critical impact.
